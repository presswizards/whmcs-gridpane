# GridPane Server Module for WHMCS
This project was built to connect WHMCS with GridPane.com's API service so we can create sites within WHMCS.

***Discliamer: First this is not quite ready for production use so use at your own risk.***

**Install:**
1. Download this repo.
2. Unzip to your local machine.
3. Upload "modules" to your root WHMCS directory.
4. Edit the /modules/servers/gridpane/includes/config.php file to include the GridPane API key along with the root URL of the WHMCS install.

**Activate & Configure**
Nothing fancy is required to activate the module, just upload it and it's ready to go. There's no license or anything to worry about.

**Create your product**
1. Create a product in WHMCS
2. Select the server as "GridPane"
3. Determine your product's default settings
4. Save the product
5. Go crazy and sell all the things.
